# DrawingTool

# Description (en)
An app made by me that allows the user to draw on the screen with his finger. 
 Features:
    + manage the colors you want to use for drawing (the pallete)
    + store the pallete on a local database
    + chose a color using the rgb constructor interactively
    + save the image in internal format, to be able to continue the work where you stoped
    + load the work you saved
    + export the image in png format, to see outside the app
    + import different color sets from the web ( for example: "green colors", "red colors",... )
